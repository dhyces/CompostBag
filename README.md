The compost bag is a utility item that allows you to compost items on the go, without needing to place down any pesky blocks!
# In GUI
While in a GUI, the bag can be right-clicked to compost an item, input bonemeal, or remove bonemeal. Holding down right-click will speed up the process! You can also carry the bag with the mouse and right-click on slots to compost many items at once, pick up bonemeal, or remove bonemeal.
# In World
In the world, the item can be used just like bonemeal to grow crops and saplings, grass and other flora. It also works in dispensers.
